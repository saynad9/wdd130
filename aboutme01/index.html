    <h2>Nadia Rangel</h2>
    <p>Hello, my Name is Nadia. I was born in Veracruz Mexico but have lived in Houston TX 
        sice the early 90's. I am a convert to the church. My family and I got baptized when 
        we came to the USA. I am married and have two amazing boys ages 22 and 15 years
        old. They love playing basketball and baseball, I love going to their games.</p>
    <p>My favorite movies are the Harry Potter, The Nightmare Before Christmas and A 
        Christmast Carol. I have two dogs, a lab and a schnauzer. I love chocolate and bacon, not together of course, and my favorite food is Mexican food.</p>
    <p>I like spending time with my family and friends. I like learning new things and hobbies. 
        I am currently working as a patient eligibility specialist, helping people apply for health programs
        available to our community. I love my job because it gives me the opportunity to help others.</p>
